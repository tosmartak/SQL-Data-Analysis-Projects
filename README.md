# SQL Data Analysis Projects

### List of data analysis projects completed using SQL. 

- <b>[Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores:](https://github.com/tosmartak/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20Public%20School%20Test%20Result%20Scores/notebook.ipynb)</b> Every year, school test results play a pivotal role in deciding the fate of millions of students. Also, analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing SAT performance from NYC's public schools to examine how performance varies by borough, identified how many schools failed to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the New York city!
- <b>[Analyzing American Baby Name Trends:](#)</b> What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes, through categorization and ranking techniques. Understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!
