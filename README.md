# SQL Data Analysis Projects

### List of data analysis projects completed using SQL. 

- <b>[Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores:](https://github.com/tosmartak/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20Public%20School%20Test%20Result%20Scores/notebook.ipynb)</b> Every year, school test results play a pivotal role in deciding the fate of millions of students. Also, analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing SAT performance from NYC's public schools to examine how performance varies by borough, identified how many schools failed to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the New York city!

- <b>[Analyzing American Baby Name Trends:](https://github.com/tosmartak/SQL-Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Analyzing%20American%20Baby%20Name%20Trends/notebook.ipynb)</b> What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes, through categorization and ranking techniques. Understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!

- <b>[The Golden Age of Video Games:](https://github.com/tosmartak/SQL-Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/The%20Golden%20Age%20of%20Video%20Games/notebook.ipynb)</b> In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. Also searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

- <b>[Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue:]()</b> In this work, I analyzed product data for an online sports retail company, diving into product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings, as well as revenue and website traffic to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!
