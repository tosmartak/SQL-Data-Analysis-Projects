#### [Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores:](#) 
Every year, school test results play a pivotal role in deciding the fate of millions of students. Also, analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing SAT performance from NYC's public schools to examine how performance varies by borough, identified how many schools failed to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the New York city!
